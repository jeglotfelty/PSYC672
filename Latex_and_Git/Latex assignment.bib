	abstract = {Depression is one of the leading causes of disability, and, if left unmanaged, it can increase the risk for suicide. The evidence base on the determinants of depression is fragmented, which makes the interpretation of the results across studies difficult. The objective of this study is to conduct a thorough synthesis of the literature assessing the biological, psychological, and social determinants of depression in order to piece together the puzzle of the key factors that are related to this condition. Titles and abstracts published between 2017 and 2020 were identified in {PubMed}, as well as Medline, Scopus, and {PsycInfo}. Key words relating to biological, social, and psychological determinants as well as depression were applied to the databases, and the screening and data charting of the documents took place. We included 470 documents in this literature review. The findings showed that there are a plethora of risk and protective factors (relating to biological, psychological, and social determinants) that are related to depression; these determinants are interlinked and influence depression outcomes through a web of causation. In this paper, we describe and present the vast, fragmented, and complex literature related to this topic. This review may be used to guide practice, public health efforts, policy, and research related to mental health and, specifically, depression.},

	abstract = {'Depression is a common, debilitating, and potentially lethal disorder.' This is a standard opening to many a scientific paper on depression. And it is often followed by some very grim statistics. Over 300 million people in the world are estimated to live with depression, and the disorder is ranked by {WHO} as the single largest contributor to global disability. Most worryingly, adolescents with major depressive disorder are up to 30 times more likely to commit suicide. Yet, what exactly is depression? Do all 300 million depressed people in the world suffer from the same thing, with the same aetiology? Is depression one disorder that comes in different shades of severity or is it best thought of as heterogeneous mix of problems that we have given one common name to? And, more practically, should we be treating all depression in similar ways?},
